# Bug 1 - The page is not scaling correctly on mobile or tablet devices

## Solution:
making a website responsive we need to tell browser to stop auto-resizing the page by
setting a mete tag that overide default behaviour of the browser. which have added 
at the head tag.

# Bug 2 - Logo does not appear in the header

## Solution: 
Firstly I have to check all likely issues that could make image not to show e.g checking file path
and typo error. Being Svg file i had to looking into the tag itself and found out it was not
a valid svg tag, and remove part that is invalid.

# Bug 3 - Heart icon should change color on click

the color when click. Also toggle the color back to is original color(this is an extra)

# Bug 4 - User should be able to delete cards

the modal UI. Have also register a click event on delete button and cancel button respectively
delete button to delete the card and cancel to do hide modal from view without deleting 
card.

# Bug 6 The side navigation shouldn't be displayed for screens under 480px

## Solution:
In other to achieve this behaviour media query need to be set for that viewport size.


# Bug 7 - Links in the side navigation do not work

## Solution:
Is to change href to point to an existing page rather than using # in href

# Bug 8 - Website is broken on IE11

## Solution:
object-fit propperty does not play well on internet explorer. Alternatively 
if an image is taking full width of is container is recommended using background-image 
property allows the object to be repositioned like object-fit does. some polyfill can also
be use with object-fit , but that add to application file size.

# Blocks Creation:
Have created Register to newsletter, need more clearification on the 2 block.

# Approach
Read the issues and start investigating likely causes. Also where I see need 
for improvement I added it such as heat and delete icon to clumsy, I gave them some 
space to breath. 


# Observation and Recommendation
1. I observe that thier are couple of resources on this project that should be removed
beacause is not needed to handle simple interaction with the DOM and page layout. such as JQuery , bootstrap
and other which I did not see the need for it. 

I will recommend they should be remove to reduce the size of the app for optimisation.
